# Floyd-Warshall_Calc

**Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Calculator (R)

This project is an exercise for the course "Graph Theory". It is a calculator which runs the Floyd-Warshall
algorithm in order to find the shortest paths from all nobes to all nobes(all-to-all).
Includes one fuction(myfloydWarshall.R) which someone can use it seperately from RStudio command line. Ιn this fuction the user passes as arguments one Matrix(graph) and the number of nobes.
Also includes a program which interacts with a User in RStudio envinroment. User creates a Graph as a Matrix.
